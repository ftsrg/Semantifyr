# Semantifyr

## Build

Use Java 17 for building.

Run `gradle build` to assemble the whole project, and execute all automated test, including regression testing and formal verifications. The required environment (e.g., Theta binaries) is automatically constructed by Gradle. Tests should run in a few minutes.

To execute all tests (even extremely slow, several hours long tests!), run `gradle allTests`.

NOTE: on windows machines, set script execution policy to unrestricted, because the build uses ps1 scripts.
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
