# Semantifyr

A framework to support the declarative definition of engineering model semantics.

## Build

Use Java 17 for building.

Run `gradlew build` to assemble the whole project, and execute all automated test, including regression testing and formal verifications. The required environment (e.g., Theta binaries) is automatically constructed by Gradle. Tests should run in a few minutes.

To execute all tests (even extremely slow, several days long tests!), run `gradlew allTests`.

NOTE: Verification tests use Docker to run Theta. To run the build locally, ensure you have docker installed!
